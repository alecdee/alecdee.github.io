<p>The AI is available in python as <a href="./Tetris.py">Tetris.py</a> and can be played in any
terminal.</p>

<p>The simulation above allows the user to press <i>I</i> to toggle the AI between: playing for the
user, providing optimal placement suggestions, and doing nothing. This allows the user to mess up
the state of the board and then turn on the AI to see it recover.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>Notes</h1>
<p><a href="./Tetris.py">Tetris.py</a> is a pure python tetris AI I've made that can run in any
console. It was designed to clear as many lines as possible and, therefore, play as long as
possible.</p>
<br>
<p>The AI itself uses a set of metrics that are computed from the tetris board. These metrics are
each given a weight and added together to give a board its fitness score. The final set I used is
shown below.</p>
<br>
<table class="datatable headerrow">
<tr><td>Metric</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum holes</td><td>The count of all holes on the grid. A cell is a hole if it is empty and a
filled cell is above it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum height</td><td>The sum of the column heights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>row flip</td><td>The number of times neighboring cells flip between empty and filled along a
row.</td></tr>
<tr><td>column flip</td><td>The number of times neighboring cells flip between empty and filled
along a column.</td></tr>
<tr><td>piece height</td><td>The height of the top cell of the most recently placed piece. Do not
take into account line clears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sum well</td><td>The sum of squared well heights. A well is an opening 1 cell wide, which
happens to function as a chokepoint.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The AI maps out all possible moves it can make (with the option to add human-like lag), and
records the final board states with their scores. The AI then backtracks from these final states to
generate a map of the most optimal move to make given any position on the board.</p>
<br>
<p>If a new piece is spawned, or the board changes, then a new map is generated. At each frame, the
AI looks at the current piece position, looks at the map it has made, and can immediately see what
move to make next.</p>
<br>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.colinfahey.com/tetris/tetris.html">Colin Fahey's</a> metrics as a
starting point and created a bunch of my own. I then set about finding the minimum set of metrics
that yielded good performance.</p>
<br>
<p>Finding the set of optimal weights was difficult, mostly because their performance couldn't be
predicted or approximated. The AI had to play several games with the weights to get their average
performance. The performance of weights was also very jagged and full of local minima. For that
reason, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle swarm
optimization</a> and added the ability for a particle to randomly reset itself if it became
stuck.</p>
<br>
<p>When I had settled on the final set of metrics and weights, the AI was able to clear 19,032,064
lines before I forced it to terminate. During that time, it totally cleared the board 23,588
times.</p>
